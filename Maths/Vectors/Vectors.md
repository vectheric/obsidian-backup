#definition #vector
A vector is ==a mathematical and physical quantity that has both magnitude (size or length) and direction==. In physics, vectors describe physical quantities like displacement, velocity, and force, and are often visualized as arrows whose length represents magnitude and whose arrowheads indicate direction. In mathematics and computer science, a vector can also be seen as an ordered list of numbers (components) that define its position and direction within a coordinate system.

#definition #vector


A vector is a mathematical and physical quantity that has both magnitude (size or length) and direction. In physics, vectors describe physical quantities like displacement, velocity, and force, and are often visualized as arrows whose length represents magnitude and whose arrowheads indicate direction. In mathematics and computer science, a vector can also be seen as an ordered list of numbers (components) that define its position and direction within a coordinate system.

A vector with starting point $A$ and ending point $B$ is denoted $\vec{AB}$ and read as “vector AB.” To draw the vector $\vec{AB}$, draw the line segment $AB$ and mark an arrowhead at point B and A or a vector labeled $a$ starting from a point near A, pointing diagonally upward to the right.

In [[Geometry]] and [[clone/Maths/Trigonometry/Trigonometry]], Thales's theorem states that if A, B, and C are distinct points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter, the angle ∠ ABC is a right angle. Thales's theorem is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem and is mentioned and proved as part of the 31st proposition in the third book of Euclid's Elements. It is generally attributed to Thales of Miletus, but it is sometimes attributed to Pythagoras..
## Statement:  
If a line is parallel to one side of a triangle and intersects the other two sides, it divides those two sides into corresponding segments that are proportional.

**Example:**  
In the figure, if we have $\triangle ABC$, line ($d$) intersects ($AB$) at ($D$) and ($AC$) at ($E$), and ($d \parallel BC$), then according to Thales’ Theorem:

$\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC}$ and $\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AE}{EC}$ and $\frac{DB}{AB} = \frac{EC}{AC}$

## Converse of Thales’ Theorem

**Statement:**  
If a line intersects two sides of a triangle and divides them into corresponding segments that are proportional, then that line is parallel to the remaining side of the triangle.

**Example:**  
In the figure, if we have triangle \(ABC\) and:
$\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC}$ or $\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AE}{EC}$ or $\frac{DB}{AB} = \frac{EC}{AC}$
$\rightarrow$ $(DE \parallel BC)$.

## Corollaries of Thales’ Theorem – Extended Thales’ Theorem

### Corollary 1
If a line intersects two sides of a triangle and is parallel to the remaining side, it creates a new triangle whose three sides are proportional to the three sides of the original triangle.

### Corollary 2
If a line intersects two sides of a triangle and is parallel to the remaining side, it creates a new triangle similar to the original triangle.

### Corollary 3 – Extended Thales’ Theorem
If three concurrent lines intersect two parallel lines, they cut off pairs of proportional segments on those parallel lines.

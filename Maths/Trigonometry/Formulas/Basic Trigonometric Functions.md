#formula #trigonometry #definition 
In [[clone/Maths/Trigonometry/Trigonometry]], trigonometric ratios are the ratios between edges of a right triangle. These ratios depend only on one acute angle of the right triangle, since any two right triangles with the same acute angle are similar.

So, these ratios define **functions** of this angle that are called **trigonometric functions**. Explicitly, they are defined below as functions of the known angle _A_, where _a_, _b_ and _h_ refer to the lengths of the sides in the accompanying figure.

- **Sine** (denoted sin), defined as the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.
- **Cosine** (denoted cos), defined as the ratio of the adjacent leg (the side of the triangle joining the angle to the right angle) to the hypotenuse.
- **Tangent** (denoted tan), defined as the ratio of the opposite leg to the adjacent leg.

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

$$
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}}
$$

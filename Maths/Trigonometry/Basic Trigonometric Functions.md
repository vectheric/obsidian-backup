In [[Trigonometry]], trigonometric ratios are the ratios between edges of a right triangle. These ratios depend only on one acute angle of the right triangle, since any two right triangles with the same acute angle are similar.

So, these ratios define **functions** of this angle that are called **trigonometric functions**. Explicitly, they are defined below as functions of the known angle _A_, where _a_, _b_ and _h_ refer to the lengths of the sides in the accompanying figure.

- **[Sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine")** (denoted sin), defined as the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.
- **[Cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine "Cosine")** (denoted cos), defined as the ratio of the adjacent leg (the side of the triangle joining the angle to the right angle) to the hypotenuse.
- **[Tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_\(trigonometric_function\) "Tangent (trigonometric function)")** (denoted tan), defined as the ratio of the opposite leg to the adjacent leg.

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

$$
\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}}
$$

$$
\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

$$
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}}
$$
